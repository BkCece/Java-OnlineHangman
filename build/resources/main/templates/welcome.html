            <h2>Rules of The Game:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players</li>
                <li>One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence</li>
                <li>The other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses</li>
                <li>The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word</li>
                <li>If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions</li>
                <li>If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark</li>
                <li>The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word</li>
                <li>If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins</li>
                <li>Otherwise, the other player may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram</li>
                <li>If the other player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow his opponent to complete the diagram, the game is also over</li>
                <li>The guesser can also win by guessing all the letters that appear in the word, thereby completing the word, before the diagram is completed</li>
