### Concepts and Tools
- This project uses **Spring Boot** as a tool to integrate web services into Java
- It uses the **Gradle** build system in **IntelliJ** to manage dependencies - such as for Spring Boot
- This project also uses the **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design Pattern** to take requests from the view, convert them to method calls in the model, and send the inormation back to the view for displaying
  - The Model Component: game logic and the system's representation of data that is independent of its User interface
  - The View Component: where the system represents data to the user, includes html files
  - The Controller Component: where commands are handled, using Spring Boot's @Controller annotation
